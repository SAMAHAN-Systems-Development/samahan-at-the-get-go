      'The paradigm shift which compelled us to go fully online for two years has, unfortunately, compromised the quality and accessibility of educational opportunities. With renewed hope, however, we here and now, slowly yet surely, reopen the gates of our campus through blended learning. With this, the SAMAHAN takes in stride the challenges of the online setup in initiating projects that champion the right of every child to quality and inclusive education through the power of storytelling and closely-knitted community partnerships. Here and now, inclusivity and quality in education go beyond the concentration on curriculums and teaching strategies; it is, from all angles, turning towards maximized learning and decreased barriers to equally engage in the classroom premise.',

Here and now, every gift and talent is celebrated — all for the greater purpose of becoming better men and women for others, for Mindanao, and for the country.',

In our mission to promote inclusivity and coexistence, the SAMAHAN shall take a proactive stance in initiating discourses on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Expression [SOGIE] and calling for the hopeful approval of the SOGIE or Anti-Discrimination Bill [ADB]. Now more than ever is the time to maneuver a long-term proposition for a SOGIE-specific gender sensitivity education and information dissemination. We aim to cultivate an environment that recognizes LGBTQ+ people as equals and ensures that their rights are protected in the same way that everyone else is, notwithstanding their sexual orientation.',
