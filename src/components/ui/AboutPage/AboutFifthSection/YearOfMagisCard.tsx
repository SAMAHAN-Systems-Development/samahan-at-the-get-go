              called to live upon a SAMAHAN that goes all-out in making all
              things happen we missed in the past. Rooted in our renewed sense
              of purpose, we aspire to start up once more and invigorate a
              fullest comeback, to Ateneo and beyond. Now more than ever, upon
              our return to a more vibrant university life, we strive to be at
              the get-go to a lot of things and more â€” one that is anchored to
              the values we hold close, to the causes we champion, and to the
              aspirations we nurture, all at once.

                people-centered advocacies, and bringing forth concrete actions
                in building a student government that is adaptive,
                transformative, and closer to its people, onwards to our real
                Atenean dream.
