        The Department of Campaigns and Advocacies was established in 2019. It
        serves as the advocacy arm of the SAMAHAN Central Board, under the
        Office of the SAMAHAN President. It is tasked to emerge, empower, and
        safeguard the knowledge and actions of the students in their initiatives
        of realizing their social responsibilities as men and women for others,
        serving for the common good. The department will mainly materialize
        priority advocacies from the SAMAHAN Central Board, United Nations
        Sustainable Development Goals, as well as Ateneo de Davao Universityâ€™s
        Vision and Mission. It envisions every Atenean to actualize the Ignatian
        values and to become dedicated to a lifelong journey of service for
        social justice and common good through active engagement in campaigns
        and advocacies inside and outside the university. Together, we will
        bring a SAMAHAN that will offer genuine service and commitment to do
        more.
