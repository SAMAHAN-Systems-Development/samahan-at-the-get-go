It is tasked to emerge, empower, and safeguard the knowledge and actions of the students in their initiatives of realizing their social responsibilities as men and women for others, serving for the common good. The department will mainly materialize priority advocacies from the SAMAHAN Central Board, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as well as Ateneo de Davao Universityâ€™s Vision and Mission. It envisions every Atenean to actualize the Ignatian values and to become dedicated to a lifelong journey of service for social justice and common good through active engagement in campaigns and advocacies inside and outside the university. Together, we will bring a SAMAHAN that will offer genuine service and commitment to do more."
